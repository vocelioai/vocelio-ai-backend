## 📋 **Deployment Steps**

### 1. Final Code Preparation
```bash
# Run final checks
npm run test
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm run build
```

### 2. Database Deployment
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard
1. Execute SUPABASE_COMPLETE_SCHEMA.sql
2. Execute SUPABASE_LOGIC_FUNCTIONS.sql
3. Verify all tables and functions created
4. Test sample queries
```

### 3. Environment Setup
```bash
# In Railway Dashboard
1. Add all environment variables from .env.production.template
2. Verify sensitive values are correctly set
3. Test database connection
```

### 4. Service Deployment
```bash
# Deploy services in order
railway up --service api-gateway
railway up --service voice-service
railway up --service campaign-service
railway up --service analytics-service
railway up --service call-service
railway up --service dashboard
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Test critical endpoints
curl https://your-api.railway.app/health
curl https://your-api.railway.app/api/auth/health
curl https://your-api.railway.app/api/campaigns

# Test real-time features
# Test webhook endpoints
# Verify dashboard functionality
```

## 🚨 **Post-Deployment Monitoring**
